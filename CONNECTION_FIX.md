## 🛠 **Technical Details**

The "connection error" was actually a network mismatch. The contracts are deployed successfully to the Hardhat network, but the frontend was trying to connect to a different network endpoint. 

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ Contracts deployed to correct network
- ✅ Environment variables updated  
- ✅ Frontend configuration synchronized
- ✅ Network diagnostics implemented

**The marketplace is now fully functional!** 🎉
