# CarbonX Full-Stack Extensions

This project has been extended with:

- `backend/` â€” FastAPI server with auth and trading endpoints
- `smart_contracts/` â€” Hardhat workspace with a CarbonCreditToken ERC-20
- Frontend pages: `/login`, `/signup`, `/dashboard`

## Run Backend (FastAPI)

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend (Next.js)

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set environment variables in `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000
# Optional: server-only thirdweb key (do NOT prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC)
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_thirdweb_secret_key
```

## Run Contracts (Hardhat)

```powershell
cd smart_contracts
npm install
npm run build
npm run node
# in another terminal
npm run deploy
```

Copy the deployed address into the Dashboard Token panel to interact (mint/test).

## Troubleshooting Dashboard API

The Dashboard calls the FastAPI backend on `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). If you see errors near `apiGet`/`fetch`:

1. Ensure the backend is running on port 8000 (see "Run Backend").
2. If you changed the port, set the env var before starting Next:

```powershell
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = "http://127.0.0.1:8001"; npm run dev
```

3. The API helper has an 8s timeout and improved error messages to help identify connection issues.

## Engine-based ERC1155 Mint (Server)

Environment variables for Engine (set in `.env` or your host env):

```
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_thirdweb_secret_key
# Optional: Engine base URL (defaults to https://api.thirdweb.com/v1/transactions)
THIRDWEB_ENGINE_URL=https://api.thirdweb.com/v1/transactions
# Required if you don't provide `from` in API requests
THIRDWEB_SERVER_WALLET=0xYourServerWalletAddress
```

New API routes (Next.js App Router):

- POST `/api/engine/erc1155/claim`
  - Body (default signature): `{ chainId, contractAddress, to, tokenId, quantity, from? }`
  - Or custom: `{ chainId, contractAddress, method, params, from? }`
  - Returns Engine transaction object (e.g., `{ id, status, ... }`).

- GET `/api/engine/tx?id=...`
  - Fetch a transaction by id to check status/hash.

PowerShell example to enqueue a mint:

```powershell
$body = @{ chainId = "137"; contractAddress = "0x..."; to = "0x..."; tokenId = 0; quantity = 1 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/engine/erc1155/claim -ContentType application/json -Body $body
```
